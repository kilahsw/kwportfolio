				<br />
				Developer and Creative - it is an incredibly broad range of skills, but
				I've always believed in doing all the things that make you feel alive.
				Art does that for me, in every form. <br />
				<br /> I write to process experiences, and my blog, Switch(), details a
				most turbulent (and rewarding) one - learning to code. I act to
				experience what it means to physically bring a vision to life, and I've
				been fortunate enough to have roles in the national commercials you'll
				see on my reel. <br />
				<br />
				And, developing is art. It is starting with nothing and building an app
				that is equally inviting, responsive, and captivating. <br />
				<br />
				I've spent the last 18 years in various corporate management roles
				learning the ins and outs of working with people. Those roles schooled
				me on the importance of connections which, I believe, are the foundation
				on which everything is built.
				<br />
				<br />
				I'm a front end developer, who most enjoys working in React and Gatsby,
				with a sizeable working knowledge of the backend. I'm a writer, I'm an
				actor, I'm an artist.
				<br />
				<br />
				My name is Kilah, and I look forward to bringing your vision to life.
